## Short Notes

#### Data Structures 
- They are containers for data with the goal of reading/writing and storing data in a specific way.

#### Algorithms
- They are steps which influence data structures to solve a task efficiently.

#### Time Complexity
- It is a function of the time taken for a program/algorithm to complete execution.

#### Space Complexity
- It is the function of space taken by a program/algorithm to work.

#### Bitwise
- ~ (bitwise not) takes one's complement of the number.
- ^ (XOR) results in 1 only if both the bits are different.
- <b>Signed</b> integers range from -2^31 to 2^32 - 1.
- Left Shift: <b>\<\<</b> shifts the operand to the left in binary. Essentially multiplying.
- Right Shift: <b>\>\></b> shifts the operand to the right in binary. Essentially dividing.

#### Stable vs Unstable Sorting
- Consider the array [1, 5(1st), 7, 10, 5(2nd)] which has two 5's.
- Stable sorting here will place the 1st '5' before the second one while Unstable may or may not do that.
- Stable: [1, 5(1), 5(2), 7, 10], Unstable: [1, 5(2), 5(1), 7, 10]
